## Superpixels through Iterative CLEarcutting (SICLE)

This is the implementation of the superpixel segmentation method _Superpixels through Iterative CLEarcutting_(SICLE) as proposed in:
- **F.Belém, B.Perret, J.Cousty, S.Guimarães, A.Falcão.** [_Efficient Multiscale Object-based Superpixel Framework_](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2204.03533). ArXiv preprint.
- **F.Belém, I.Borlido, L.João, B.Perret, J.Cousty, S.Guimarães, A.Falcão.** [_Fast and Effective Superpixel Segmentation Using Accurate Saliency Estimation_](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-19897-7_21). Discrete Geometry and Mathematical Morphology, pg. 261-273, 2022.
- **F.Belém, I.Borlido, L.João, B.Perret, J.Cousty, S.Guimarães, A.Falcão.** [_Novel Arc-Cost Functions and Seed Relevance Estimations for Compact and Accurate Superpixels_](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10851-023-01156-9). Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision, 2023.

This software includes nine programs:
- One for creating an object's minimum bounding box image from a ground-truth;
- One for creating an image whose superspels are colored by their mean color;
- One for assisting the visualization of the segmentation by overlaying the superspel borders; 
- One for creating an image whose superspels are pseudo-colored;
- One for relabelling the superspels from a superspel segmentation;
- One for running a SICLE method;
- One for running the SICLE method in its optimized compact version;
- One for running the SICLE method in its optimized irregular version;
- One for assessing a superspel segmentation;

Please cite the aforementioned papers (preferably the last one) if you use any of this software in your own project.

### Hardware, Setup and Requirements

The project was developed in **C** under a **Linux-based** operational system; therefore, it is **NOT GUARANTEED** to work properly in other systems (_e.g._ Windows and macOS). Moreover, the same applies for **non-GCC** compilers, such as Clang and MinGW.

All code within this project were developed, compiled and tested using the following programs:
- **[GNU GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)**: version 7.5.0
- **[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)**: version 4.1

This code was implemented and evaluated in a computer with the following specifications:
- **CPU:** 64-bit Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 @ 3.20 GHz
- **Memory:** 8GB RAM

The library has in-built support for handling **PNM** images. For enabling external library support, please refer to the [README](externals/README.md) file within the **externals** folder.

### Compiling

If your computer meets the aforementioned requirements, you may run the commands below for compiling the library and all the demonstration programs.
```bash
make lib
make demo
```
Or simply run one of the following commands for compiling both latter at once.
```bash
make
make all
```

For removing the files generated from compilation, one may run the following rule.
```bash
make clean
```

### Running

After compiling, one may run any of the demonstration programs in **demo** folder, such as _RunSICLE_ with the option _--help_ for outputting the possible parameters for that program, as it is shown below:
```bash
./bin/RunSICLE --help
```
Then, the program will indicate a brief description of **all parameters** (both required and optional) for its proper execution.
